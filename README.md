# 2048 in Assembly

A 2048 implementation made by [me](https://github.com/11808s8/) and Ricardo Turella using 8086 Assembly for Computer Architecture II discipline in Universidade de Caxias do Sul.

It's a clone of 2048, featuring a scoreboard of top 5 players, an AI implementation that plays the game for N times (N being up to the user to decide) and a playable version of the game.

The .exe was generated using emu8086. (NASM, TASM and MASM weren't tested for and I'm pretty sure the syntax will not let you generate the .exe with them...)
